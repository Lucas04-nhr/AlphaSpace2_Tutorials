# AlphaSpace2_Tutorials

The following tutorials were made for the [AlphaSpace2 platform](https://github.com/lenhsherr/AlphaSpace2). The tutorials below show how AlphaSpace2 and Beta Clusters can be used for a wide variety of applications in drug discovery, from binding site detection, comparison, and design

* [Calculating Beta Cluster Features](https://github.com/Vanabins28/AlphaSpace2_Tutorials/blob/master/Beta_cluster_features.ipynb)
* [Scripts to Compare Binding Sites between different proteins](https://github.com/Vanabins28/AlphaSpace2_Tutorials/blob/master/Binding_Site_comparison.ipynb)
* [NMR Ensemble comparison of the MDM2/MDM4 Binding Sites](https://github.com/Vanabins28/AlphaSpace2_Tutorials/blob/master/MDM2_MDM4_NMR_comparison.ipynb)
* [Pocket Community Detection for CDK2](https://github.com/Vanabins28/AlphaSpace2_Tutorials/blob/master/CDK2_Communities.ipynb)
* [Pocket Guided Fragment Based Design](https://github.com/Vanabins28/AlphaSpace2_Tutorials/blob/master/Fragment_to_Lead.ipynb)
